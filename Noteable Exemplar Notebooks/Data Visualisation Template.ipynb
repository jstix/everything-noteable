    "\n",
    "Noteable's Data Visualization seres is a learning resource that aims to develop data literacy skills, largely inspired by the work from Callysto in Canada, funded by the Canadian Government. This companion resource walks learners through how the data visualisation is created and interpreted by a data scientist. \n",

    "The steps of the data analysis process are listed below and applied to each weekly topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Question - What are we trying to answer? \n",
    "2. Gather - Find the data source(s) you will need. \n",
    "3. Organize - Arrange the data, so that you can easily explore it. \n",
    "4. Explore - Examine the data to look for evidence to answer the question. This includes creating visualizations. \n",
    "5. Interpret - Describe what's happening in the data visualization. \n",
    "6. Communicate - Explain how the evidence answers the question. "
